📝 Ethical Reflection —

In one of my recent AI projects, I worked on building a predictive model designed to support decision-making in a real-world scenario. As I learned more about AI ethics, I began to recognize that technical accuracy alone is not enough. Moving forward, I intend to design all my AI systems using the principles of transparency, fairness, privacy, and accountability.

First, I will ensure responsible data sourcing. Before collecting or using data, I will verify that consent was obtained, sensitive information is minimized, and data does not reinforce historical inequalities. I will document data provenance and evaluate whether demographic groups are fairly represented. If imbalances exist, I will apply techniques such as re-sampling, reweighing, or synthetic data augmentation while acknowledging limitations.

Second, I will prioritize fairness audits throughout development. Using tools like AIF360, SHAP, or model cards, I will routinely check for disparate impact or biased patterns. If the model disproportionately affects vulnerable groups, I will apply mitigation strategies such as algorithmic debiasing, feature masking, or fairness-aware optimization.

Third, I will maintain a strong commitment to transparency and explainability. This includes using interpretable models when possible, offering clear explanations for model decisions, and documenting assumptions, risks, and intended use. Users should understand how and why AI reaches conclusions.

Fourth, I will incorporate human oversight. Automated outputs should support—not replace—human judgement, especially in high-risk applications like finance, healthcare, or criminal justice. I will define guardrails for human review, appeals, and error handling.

Finally, I will follow legal and ethical frameworks such as GDPR, the EU Trustworthy AI Guidelines, and institutional policies. My goal is to build AI systems that are not only technically effective but also socially responsible, inclusive, and aligned with human values.
